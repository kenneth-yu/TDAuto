          Norman and his staff are down to earth service oriented people. You can't ask more.`

          text: `Norman and the crew are some of the most honest, hard working people I've met. After having a horrible experience with South Slope Auto (they would keep my car for months at a time, and would charge me twice when they didn't fix the issue initially and had to do the service again) I feel so lucky to have brought my car in to T & D. As a woman car owner, I've always had to have my guards up super high with every mechanic consultation. What an amazing feeling it is to know that whenever I have any issue with my car, Norman will let me know exactly what's going on without piling on a bunch of other issues that would cost me extra. I used to wait at least 6 weeks to get my car back for a check engine light, and now I get it back in 2-3 days.
      
          This car shop is the definition of no-nonsense; it is their goal to get your car taken care of as quickly as possible and to do such a good job that you won't have to come back. Everyone in there treats me with such great respect and hospitality which I really appreciate as a girl going into such a male-majority space.
          
          Norman is super easy to reach, is a great communicator, passionate about what he does, and always makes sure his customers' needs come first. This team is the best mechanic crew in the city, you will never regret bringing your car here!`

          text: "Incredible experience here. I wouldn't want to go anywhere else. Everyone is so friendly, honest and very communicative. A deer did some serious damage to my car, and Norman walked me through everything with the insurance and made all the repairs, it was a most seamless experience. I thought my car was going to get totaled and they repaired it GOOD AS NEW! I would go back in a heartbeat. When the accident happened, the shop was closing but Norman stayed open to wait for my car to be dropped off. I am so grateful to have found this place and I will be back."

          text: "Been going to T&D for years. Norman and his crew are good on what they do. He's honest and straight up on what needs to be done for the car. He doesn't sell you unnecessary repairs to charge you extra. It's hard to find an honest and good body shop these days. Will continue to come back."
